			Sentiment Analysis of Immigration Policy in European Countries <br><br>
			This Fall I am working with professor Symons as his research assistant. 
			My current research consists of sentiment analysis in general, as well as 
			working with Langchain and OpenAI for implementation. 
			<br>
			I also help Dr. Symons run a lab for people at KU interested in philosophy of technology 
			and the ethics of AI to collaborate, discuss projects with peers, and give and provide
			feedback.

		<h2>Past: </h2>
		<p id="ACER"> ACER <br> (Automated Card-Playing Entertainment Robot)<br><br>
			ACER was my senior design project for my BS of Computer Science at KU. <br>
			ACER is a software for Aldebaran's NAO robots that allows it to play
			simple card games with multiple human opponents. 
			<br>
			Mainly created with python code, me and my team worked for a total of 10 months
			on this project for our Senior Design class and the University of Kansas. We 
			were able to use Aldebaran's NAO robots and the associated interface, Choregraphe, 
			in our project. The NAO robot has computer vision modules built in, as well as 
			prehensile fingers and the ability to speak and interpret language. 
			We were able to use and manipulate all of these features in tandem, along with python programs, to 
			bring our project to life. <br><br>
			The end result was a success, and we created our robot, ACER, that was successful
			in playing card games with human opponents. 
			The two games we were able to implement were Crazy-8s and Black Jack, although with the
			framework we put in place, it would be very simple to add more card games to 
			ACER's arsenal.

			Magic Mirror <br><br>
			Me and my peers worked to make a customized smart-mirror based on the Magic Mirror framework
				to help homeless veterans in Tunnels to Towers's tiny home initiative. <br>
			My team created the Magic Mirror for a class on real-world design in spring 2023.
